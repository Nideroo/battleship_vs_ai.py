Final Project for Codecademy CS Path: CS101

A Battleship game playable in the terminal against a computer. AI might be a misnomer, as the computer simply randomly guesses targets that they have not yet guessed.

My first project in Python! After completing the "Learn Python 3" course as well as CS101 of the "Computer Science" career path on Codecademy, it was time to test my skills with a portfolio project.
Disclaimer: I am aware that the usage of latitude and longitude is not completely correct, but I hope that it can be excused for narrative purposes :).

The game runs completely in your terminal and renders most of the game using unicode characters for some added flair. A reminder at the start of the game will show you the rules as follows:

"In Battleship, you are the captain of a fleet of 5 ships that are exchanging fire with an equally sized enemy fleet.

Your objective is sinking all of the enemy's ships before they sink yours. 
Each turn, you will try to hit them with missiles by entering coordinates of squares on the board. The enemy will do the same. 
Neither one knows the exact location of the other's fleet, only where they have hit or missed.

At the start of a new game, you will place your ships of varying length on the board either horizontally or vertically.
Ships must be fully placed on the board and may not overlap.

Taking turns, both fleets fire missiles and receive confirmation of hits and misses.
Furthermore, you will also be notified when a missile has just sunk the last part of an enemy ship.

As soon as one captain has lost all their ships, the game ends.

Have fun!"

Input is handled case-insensitively where appropriate. Although I encountered and fixed countless bugs during the creation of this project, it is always possible that you will find a brand new one yourself. It would be highly appreciated if you let me know, so I can fix it :)
