**************************************************************************************************************************************
In Battleship, you are the captain of a fleet of {len(SHIPS_LENGTH)} ships that are exchanging fire with an equally sized enemy fleet.

Your objective is sinking all of the enemy's ships before they sink yours. 
Each turn, you will try to hit them with missiles by entering coordinates of squares on the board. The enemy will do the same. 
Neither one knows the exact location of the other's fleet, only where they have hit or missed.

At the start of a new game, you will place your ships of varying length on the board either horizontally or vertically.
Ships must be fully placed on the board and may not overlap.

Taking turns, both fleets fire missiles and receive confirmation of hits and misses.
Furthermore, you will also be notified when a missile has just sunk the last part of an enemy ship.

As soon as one captain has lost all their ships, the game ends.

Have fun!
